# Real_Estate_Price_Prediction_UsingML
A real Estate Price Prediction Project implemented using Data Science and ML.
A real Estate Price Prediction Project implemented using Data Science and ML. This data science project walks through step by step process of building a real estate price prediction model. The model is built using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. During model building almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc has been covered. Technology and tools wise this project covers,
1) Python
2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3) Matplotlib for data visualization
4) Sklearn for model building
5) Jupyter notebook as IDE
